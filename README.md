Project built on the basis of [devChallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/5ZnOYsSXM24JWnCsNFlt) designe. I used the React framework, each visible element on the page is a separate component. For personal information component I used data passed from file, for project component I used github api to show my 4 latest favorite project.
